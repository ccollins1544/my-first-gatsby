Full Web Developer that loves solving problems. I really enjoy working with all parts of full-stack development. I'm self-motivated and have the ability to learn and adapt to whatever team role I'm in. <!-- end --> I have a good background in servers and migrating to the AWS cloud. I've mostly worked with Ec2 and s3 services on AWS. I've worked with developing websites for small businesses and a dozen of my own dev projects that I have posted on my portfolio. I feel most confident in the MERN stack and continue to learn and develop my skills in JAM, MEAN, and some of the other frameworks that deal with REACT and JavaScript. I take pride in my work and strive to always provide quality work.
